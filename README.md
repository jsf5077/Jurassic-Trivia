# Jurassic Trivia
How well do you remember this classic film? Do you think you're good enough to get them all correct? Don't take too long or the T-rex will get you!

## What is this?

This project is to demonstrate the ability to use javascript to create a web-based trivia game. One of the key functions to take away from this game is the use of time intervals. As demonstrated in the game, the time interval helps keep the game moving along which also challenges the player to move quickly to complete the game. 

## How to Play:
-Although this game is mobile ready, for best user experience it's recommended that this game is played on a desktop.
- Open the app/game: https://jsf5077.github.io/Jurassic-Trivia/
- Click the Start Game button to initiate the trivia game.
- The at beginning of each round you are given a multiple choice question with 20 seconds to answer
- If you answer correctly, you will be prompted that you've answered correctly with a fun gif. 
- If you answer incorrectly, you will be prompted that you've answered incorrectly and obtain a visit from that guy we love to hate.
- if you don't answer at all... well you become dino food before moving on to the next round. 
- At the end of the game you are prompted with the final score: Correct total, Incorrect total, and questions unanswered.
- Click play again to try and better your score!
