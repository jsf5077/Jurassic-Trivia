# TriviaGame
Hello and welcome to Jurassic Trivia!

This project is to demonstrate the ability to use javascript to create a web-based trivia game. One of the key functions to take away from this game is the use of time intervals. As demonstated in the game, the time interval helps keep the game moving along which also challenges the player to move quickly to complete the game. 

A project like this is useful because it shows you how to have control over when things happen on your page. Time intervals are a very powerful tool and the possibilities to utillize them are endless. 

If you are interested in developing your own trivia game with jquery it is highly recommended you study up on timer intervals with jquery along with how to use jquery to create html elements like buttons. 

Before you begin coding, it is essential that you spend some time on your pseudocode. When you think you're done that, go back and revise it because this game is trickier than you may think and it's important you don't miss any fine details. 

If you get stuck, sources I use are stackOverflow and w3 along with referencing from the bootstrap (for styling) and jquery websites.
